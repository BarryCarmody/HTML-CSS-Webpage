# Assignment Description
COMP30680 Web App Development - Assignment 1: HTML and CSS  
In this assignment you are required to create a website using HTML and CSS. You can choose one of the following: 
1. A personal website
2. A website for a piece of media (Book, TV Series, Film, or Video Game)
3. A website for a charity or organisation of your choice.  
The website should have five pages including a homepage (index.html), a gallery page (e.g. page displaying multiple images in a structured format), and three pages of your own choice.  
You should ensure that your HTML and CSS code is valid and should make appropriate use of HTML and CSS to separate the content and presentation (styling) of the site.  
Alongside these general requirements, your website should include the following: 
▪ Links to both your own pages and external webpages. 
▪ A navigation bar 
▪ At least one table used for an appropriate purpose 
▪ At least one list (ordered or unordered) 
▪ At least one local or embedded video 
▪ At least five CSS3 and four HTML5 specific elements 
▪ Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. display, position) 
▪ Make use of both inline and block elements 
Marking 
This assignment corresponds to 20% of the total module mark. You will receive a letter grade for the assignment, based on the Computer Science grading scale. The following aspects of your work will be considered for grading purposes:
a.	Making appropriate and valid use of HTML and CSS. 
b.	Correctly including the elements described above. 
c.	Overall impression and quality of the overall design. 
d.	Going beyond the parts of HTML and CSS described in the lectures and practical classes to explore features of HTML and CSS that make a website responsive.

Submitting 
Submit only a single zip file to BrightSpace. The zip file should include a folder containing your website and an optional readme file.  
If included the readme file should be brief and focus on identifying where in your site the elements listed above have been included. To receive high marks on point (d) above the readme file should also describe how you have explored additional features of HTML and CSS.  
Please name your zip file using the following format: “Firstname_Lastname_A1_COMP30680.zip”. The deadline for submission is available on BrightSpace. 
Code reuse 
The website must be your own work. Any large code snippets that are not directly written by you (e.g. used from a tutorial or from online sources) must be referenced as such within your code. You must directly comment the code to explain its source.
Failure to reference code that is not your own will be treated as plagiarism.  
The use of libraries and frameworks (e.g. BootStrap) is not permitted in this assignment. 
Code validation: 
Your website should be consistent with the HTML 5 standard.  
All code submitted in this assignment will be checked for validity using the following: 
• HTML: https://validator.w3.org/ 
• CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
