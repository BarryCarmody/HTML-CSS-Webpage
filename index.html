          1976: 20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox do not expect Star Wars to be a success at the box office but the novelisation 'The Adventures of Luke Skywalker' has sold well before the release of the movie.
          In an attempt to recoup some of the money they've lost on the production of the movie, Fox commission Alan Dean Foster to ghost write the sequel to his novelisation.

        This has come with restraints. If Stars Wars performs well enough this sequel may be turned in to a low-budget sequel. 
        There was no space fights or large landscapes allowed. 
        Also, there was to be no Han Solo, as Fox did not believe Harrison Ford would return for a sequel.
        </p>  
        <p>
        Foster must now write the sequel to, unbeknownst to him, one of the biggest movies in history.
